  <h1> Welcome to the infographica project </h1>
  <p>The ongoing search for exoplanets is an awesome  mission for mankind to embark on. Hopefully it may shed light on the possibility of extraterrestrial life somewhere in the Universe.</p>

  <p>Planets have been discovered using various methods. Transit photometry has been the most effective method of discovering extrasolar planets</p>

   <p>Some extrasolar systems have more planets, some have less. On average they have more than one.</p>
